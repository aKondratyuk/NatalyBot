{name}, if YOU WANT to have the BEST WIFE, and REAL PASSIONATE WOMAN…

Don\'t be shy! I am here and I am for you!!!

Honestly, I\'m tired to be lonely and I hate rude Ukrainian men! They don\’t know how treat their women and how to create the happy family. How about the sad experience with the women in your country? I guess that you have the same situation. The women from your country are selfish. The man must always be the evildoer, and she the victim who needs help and sympathy. They cannot pity their ex-husbands; indeed, their ex-husbands must always be the most horrible pigs on the planet. I guess that we will be happy with you after your sad experience with the women from your country and after my unpleasant cost with Ukrainian men.

All of us want or need to be loved. The need for love is one of the most basic human impulses. I come here and I hope to find my soul mate here, the person who will love me, cherish me, respect me and understand me, who will give his support and strong shoulder to me in the moments of weakness! In return I will be happy to be his support and force in life, his inspiration and beloved woman!

I know that to find this special person is not an easy but if we have met each other here we are on the right way! We need to reveal our inner world, to know each other better through our communication and hopefully to meet each other in real life... To be honest, I will be glad to invite you to my country! It will be my pleasure to be your personal guide YES I AM READY TO MEET WITH YOU AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, DEAR!

How is the situation with COVID-19 in your country now?

Waiting for the serious answer,
Anna
