Dear {name}, are you ready to fall in love ? Is your heart free? If yes why not to try the chance to become happy with me ? ;)

I was not lucky in love in Ukraine , that\’s why I\’m here , on this dating site .

Everybody has own unhappy story as so I do . But I\’m optimist and believe that who\’s searching , that one will find . ;)

Can you tell me your story , why you\’re here ? Describe me your way please .
I\’ll share with you mine in few words .

I was 20 when I fell in love . We had got marriage . As it turned out he loved alcohol more than loved me .That\’s not secret how drunk people can behave . I\’ve been enduring with his actions for 4 years and then he met another lady . Now I understand that it was my happiness , it was my liberation .
I\'ve been enjoying my freedom for 2 years after divorcing .I didn\'t want to be in relations and I couldn\'t even to imagine myself with a man.

But my freedom led to loneliness . Now I feel I\’m ready to start relations and to fall in love .

I\’m not open with unknown people and it’s hard for me to start speaking with strangers . That\’s why I decided to use the internet for searching my soulmate .I suggest it\’s comfortable to meet man in real life after communication , after checking our mutual interests . I think it saves time ;)

That\’s why I\’m writing to you - to tell something about myself and to hear something about you ;)

I like art and often visit theatre and different exhibitions , sometimes I take part in it . Is this sphere close to you ?

I\’m good in drawing portraits and make to order . It\’s one way how I can make money . :D Do you have your own portrait ?I could do it for you as a gift ;)

Do you like honey ? Hope you\’re not allergic about it :D Because my hobby and another way of making money is beekeeping ;) I live not far from forest , so this activity is actual for me .

Can you describe me the place where you live in ? I\’ll draw it in my imagination . It may be the idea for my future picture ;)By the way , you can see my two pictures in photo gallery ;)
In one word I do what I love , and I love what I do . And what about you ?

I hope to see your reply in my inbox .

Hope I\’ve made right decision –to write you today .

Have a nice day .
Maria
