Let\'s stop our loneliness together, {name}!  Are you here with serious intentions, {name}?
I\'ll try to explain what I am doing here, on this dating site.

I devoted myself for raising my kids and satisfying my ex-husband\'s needs and desires . My kids are adult and have their own family, now . My ex cheated me with younger girl and I left him . I looked around and understood â€“I\'m totally lonely. I didn\'t dream about such eld. Can you understand me ? I\'m guess this site is place for lonely hearts , and each of them have own story . Can you tell me yours ?

Life is going on and I want to enjoy every minute of it. I still hope to find my man , to fall in love again .As one wise man said : \"Love for all ages !\" . I want to find someone to open new places together , raise flowers in the our garden. Watch films and discuss it together , read favorite books on the our backyard in his hugs . I don\'t want to be a part of any intrigue or games . And I will never play with your heart or feelings . I\'m that person whom you can trust on .

I hope you want the same and I\'ve done right step when decided to write you . I hope you need wise , tender woman , good faithful friend and experienced housewife . I know what men wants Wink


I look forward your reply, {name}.

Svetlana
