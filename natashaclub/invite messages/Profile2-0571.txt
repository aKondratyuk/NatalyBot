{name}, do you need some MAGIC in your LIFE? :)

You caught my attention and I would like to get to know you. Would you mind? I hope that communication with you will bring a lot of pleasure for both of us.

Let me tell you something about myself. I\’m Ukrainian girl Olena. My profession is teacher. I think it is very feminine and sexy: dresses, blouses, skirts, high hills… Have you ever had a crush with your pretty teacher? Are you ready for today\’s lesson? If not I will punish you :lol:

What kind of man am I looking for? Smart, confident, reliable. My parents taught me that relationships are work of both of partners. Woman should take care of man, gave him all her support and meet home after hard working day with tasty meal. Honey, dinner is ready! :D

I like to spend time outdoors. Travelling all around the world is my dream. I like riding bicycle. So I have nice trained legs. Do you like ladies with long legs? 8)

You should know that I am ready to leave Ukraine and start new step of my life abroad because I am fond of foreign culture, education, job, people and LIFE. I can speak English, also I\’m learning French and Polish. I will be happy near my BELOVED, no matter where he lives! I want to change everything and be happy.

I\’m waiting for your move forward. Tell me about yourself – I want to know more about you.

Your mavka,
Olena

P.S. In my next letter I will tell what “mavka” means :)
