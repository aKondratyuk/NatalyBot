{name}, Do YOU want to make SWEET DREAMS come TRUE? Together we can DO it :)

Some years ago on hot summer night I had a dream - about loving, caring and confident man with great sense of humor from far country who has come to find me and take me home - to our happy home! It was the best dream in my life... And I still remember that wonderful feeling I had! I am sure that dream was the picture of my destiny, of my future life! And I also believe I must follow it! To do everything to become closer to it! How do you think - am I close to my dream now?  
To my surprise one of my friend was registered on this site and she already meet her dream man! Of course I decided to join the site too, I don\’t want to miss my chance for a happy life .What made you to join this site?

I need warmth and attention, as every person cuddles and hugs during the lonely evenings. I\'m sure you need the same, so maybe try to make our loneliness warm for both of us? It is so easy to be happy: apple pie, warm sweater, two cups of tea and beloved by your side. Would you share it with me?

I guess you already read some information about me in my profile and I hope you like what you read, but still I have few things to share with you.

I was traveling a lot with my parents when I was younger. I was in Turkey, Austria, Slovenia, and Italy. I like Italy a lot, it\'s very beautiful country, and Austria is very clean country and people are very nice. Did you travel a lot? I do want to see ocean as I never saw it before and maybe some exotic islands and of course I dream to see Paris.

I believe eyes are the door to the soul and you can see real me deep in there… :)

So I hope my letter made you to write me back and wake up interest in you to me. It is very new thing for me and I do hope to meet here ONE & ONLY…
