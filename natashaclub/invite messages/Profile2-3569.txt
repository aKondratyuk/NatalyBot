{name}, let\’s cover OUR WORLD in LOVE and SENSATIONS!

I decide to join this place as I\’m disappointed in men in my country and their attitude to women. I know exactly that I want to find the foreign man because they have another lives\’ values and the different directions in relations with their beloved as Ukrainian men. How about your experience with the local women?

I am the one who can stand for you. I care and give all my passion and dreams for person I love. Unfortunately, I haven\’t met a man, who will be the same for me, who will value what I am doing for him, and who will always put me on the first place in his life... In my opinion when you start to think about your life, all you can really value is that you have a person who makes you happy, who you love and who loves you... Every day when you go to bed and wake up in the morning you look at this person and understand that no matter how bad it rains outside, just one kiss or smile makes your day much better :D


I call myself orchid because I can compare myself with this tender flower. I have the great collection of orchids. There are 33 flowers in my home. Will you be my daffodil? We are waiting with our girls, orchids, for the best man for us. We are going to take care about him with a lot of love and passion :oops:

Traveling and mountains are my hobby. I have been to different countries: France, Tunisia, Poland, Greece, Germany, Czech Republic, Turkey, Egypt... I like exotic places, to discover something new; I enjoy taking photos while traveling. I have a dream: to decorate the whole wall with our family photos from different places taken on holidays :)
 I am dreaming to have a house full of joy, laughter and love, a place where you always want to come and wrap yourself in the coziness of home... :wink:

I am looking forward to receive your letter and to know about your dreams... Maybe I can help you to make them true?

Sincerely, Natali
