{name}, Are you ready to MEET a REAL WOMAN or you just here to write letters?

I\’m not very long on this site and I just noticed that some people prefer endless correspondence to real actions. I hope you are not such person. I\’m here with serious intentions and I do hope to find my husband :oops:

Do you want to know what kind of person I am? I\’m active, responsible, loyal and family oriented. I love my job – I am cosmetologist. I always study to stay in touch with modern tendencies in my field. I have seminars and courses around Ukraine and abroad. I think with my profession I can work in any part of the world – people want to be beautiful :D

At this moment the most important task for me is studying foreign language. I am still studying English but I\'m at the initial stage and have a progress!

You may be curious: why foreigner? :) I just feel that my personality is quite broad-minded and I can\’t find the right man in Ukraine. What about you: why foreign woman?

Now it is your turn to ask me anything :wink: Waiting to hear from you!

Yours,
Ksenia
