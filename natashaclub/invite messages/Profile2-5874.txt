{name}, IT IS A NEW POSSIBILITY TO CHANGE YOUR LIFE. I am ready to TRY EVERYTHING NEW with you. I am interested at another culture, traditions, mentalities and tender love which are close to my heart and soul. I continue to learn English and also French for successful communication with my foreign future man.

I am just a Woman here such sensitive and deep as White Tiger... \"Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see: I\'m just a poor boy, I need no sympathy...\" Aren\'t you?

You can be rich or poor, successful or loser, wise or naively, but you will never deceive yourself repeating, that you do not need anyone in your life.

We are not created to be alone! People are meant to be together. Then we become the One, the Whole, a Strong and Meaningful Unit. It will take lots of courage, but at the end it is worth it. Do you long to experience this again in your life?

Please answer me because I am waiting for your decision!

Olga
