Hello, my dear King {name}!
\“If I do my best to treat my man as a King, he will treat me like a Queen\”- I have heard this phrase for a long of time. And I always think that I will do all my best for my King.
But where is he?
Where can I find him?
How will I feel that\’s He is?
Why haven\’t I met him to this time yet?
I ask myself it so many times.
In my childhood my father called me a beautiful princess and told me how nice prince would find me one day. I listened to him and believed. Maybe he spoiled me with it. What do you think?
So many people say me:\” Ira, you are so beautiful! You are so clever! You are so lucky!\” But I prefer they say that I am so happy!
I can\’t understand why I am alone to this time.
That\’s why I am here and I write this letter to you. Maybe I have already found Him. Maybe it\’s you, my KING!
I\’m looking forward to your reply.
Sincerely, Irina
