DEAR {name}! Accept DOSE of LOVE from me and let yourself be completely HAPPY! :D

It is hard to write to person you never saw and open your heart and soul... But I will try :)

I decided to join this site because I\'m tired to be alone and I\'m tired of this attitude from Ukrainian men to me like to a doll, just like to a silly beautiful girl! The men here do not care about my inner word and my feelings. And I feel I\'m ready for serious relations and I\'m not interested in fun or games at all.

So a little about me... I\'m a kind and well-bread lady with a devoted heart. I was born in a nice family and my parents give me all the best. I keep a healthy way of life and prefer an active rest with my friends. I like traveling, spending time outdoors, to go to the cinema or theater. I like pets and flowers.

Life is too short, so don\'t waste time and let\'s find our happiness together. I want to be your best friend, your lover, your life partner - loving wife, carrying mother of our future children. I want to share all joys and sorrows with my man â€“ with YOU.

I want to become a part of your world, your life, your heart and your soul... My heart is full of love, tenderness and passion to share with You. Would you like me to be your companion? :mrgreen

I have so optimistic thoughts towards us... Can they be true? YES! But only with you :wink:

And I will be waiting for your step...

Sincerely,
Hanna
