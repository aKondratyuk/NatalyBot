{name}, what about a CUP of CAPPUCCINO with me? :)

It is so hard to start a conversation with unknown person for a shy lady like me : )oops: ) But I try my best to be more open and I hope to get to know you better :)


I\’m Irina or shortly Ira from Kyiv. I work as a masseur, I\’m very interested in making body perfect so I have my own beauty room. My hobbies are making cosmetics, soap, different beauty things. I love nice silky skin; I hope to make beauty spa for my man… Are you ready? :)


In my free time I like to read books about psychology, body correction, diet, massage... I try to improve my knowledge and make my clients happy. I think with my profession I can work in any part of the world, what do you think?

I like to visit new places... I adore sea and beach. I was in Turkey and Poland, and I dream to see Norway, Japan, Austria and of course I dream about around world trip with my beloved. I am used to enjoy the simple things and appreciate every little moment in my life.

I start to improve my English some time ago, so maybe one day I can sing your favorite song in English. What is your favorite song? Are you afraid to sing on public? :)


One more question. My friend told me that the women abroad can financially destroy a man and crush his dreams until there is nothing left. Money is not the root of all evil, women are. I hope that it is only gossips. Am I wrong?

If you want to know something more about me - you are welcome to ask me all :)


With big hello from Kyiv,
Iryna
