Dear {name} ! Yes, I am sure it\’s you!!!

I am sure you don\’t care about what I wear or how I do my hair, you love my smile, you will never want to see me cry, at least not tears of sadness. And you will do those small things that make my day, just because you know it makes me happy!

You will call me beautiful instead of hot, you will kiss my forehead, you will listen to my heartbeat, you stay awake just to watch how I sleep, you will think I am just pretty without makeup on.

What do I want to do with you? To get and drink coffee together, to take pictures, to watch movies, to go on long walks, to sing stupid songs, to hold hands, to wake up to see the sunrise, to travel to somewhere new, to listen to nice music, to watch the sunset, to do everything all over again!!!

We have so many interesting things to do!
Will you do it with me!
Awaiting for your letter!
Your Antonina
