{name}, Do YOU WANT to FIND YOUR LOVE? I know how! :)

Are you tired of endless correspondence? I joined this site not so long ago and find out that some people have a hobby – writing letters :roll: I want to meet serious man here for long-term relationships. Honestly, I want to get married for the last in my life so I\’m seriously oriented. If you feel we are looking at the same direction – please continue :)

Do you want to know my main features of character? I think it is honesty, kindness, loyalty. I\’m balanced lady and you won\’t hear me shouting. To tell you the truth I hate quarreling. I prefer to keep silent – I think it makes relationships more pleasant for both partners. How can you describe yourself?

As to my profession I\’m hairdresser. I used to work in bank but I found it wasn\’t my dream job. So I got qualification as a hairdresser and I really enjoy what I do! I think with my skills I can find a job all over the world :wink:

My main hobby is yoga – I go in for it for some years. It helps my body stay healthy and my mind stay clear. Also I like riding bicycle and running. I like sport a lot :) Do you go in for sport? What is your favorite one? By the way, not so long ago I started to visiting courses of massage. Soon I\’ll become masseur. I will make a séance for you with a great pleasure!

I dream about serious, honest and family oriented man, that has old-fashioned family values. I want you to love and care of me. Kiss me often and stay with me always. It does not matter good times or bad. We will solve all problems together. If you will love me then I will be your guiding light, which will show new sides of this life to you. Life is beautiful when you are in love. Let\'s make this life beautiful!

Your Oksana

P.S. My biggest dream is to fly on aerostat balloon :) Let\’s fly together!
