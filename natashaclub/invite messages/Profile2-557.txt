Am I the lady you are waiting for, {name}? I\'d be very glad to be the woman you want to see by your side as a life partner. I hope my letter will evoke your interest to my personality. I realize that it is not easy to understand who is in front of you due to some written lines and pretty photos. But I hope for the pleasant impression that the woman\’s smile can create.

I am at the beginning of my independent life. I completed design and sewing courses. I got a profession of a clothing designer. I have a good job at the tailoring studio. I also have my own clients and sew for them at home. I continue to improve my skills. Now I\'m at a special course of making leather clothes and accessories. I don\’t want to talk much about routine things like job, family, cooking or housework. These are not the things a young lady wishes to tell to a man.

Routines take most of the time, but I\'m convinced that pleasant moments spending with family or friends are the time we actually live for. Can we become those people for each other who are able to make every day special with a morning smile, tender kiss or gentle touch. What do you think, {name}?

I like music and dancing. I am an open and sincere person and ready to answer any of your questions. What do you want to know about me? What side of my life is the most interesting for you?

I\’m waiting for your answer

Elena
