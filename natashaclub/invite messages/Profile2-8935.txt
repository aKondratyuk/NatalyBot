Hello, dear {name}! I am so hungry to live and love!!!
So, I am ready to open my heart to new beginnings! And you?
Would you like to do it together?
I love the life and try to appreciate every moment of it. All of us are temporary guests on this planet, where values are not measured by great wealth and money. With the age I realize what is important in the life. There is the peaceful sky, the health and happy smile of your children, and the hugs of your beloved person.
Can you believe me that I have had only one man for the whole of my life? It was my husband. He was my first and only one man. I was his faithful wife all my life! But I didn\’t love him and I was not happy with him. Only now I begin to live and feel the taste of life by every my body\’s cell.
When the past has passed from you at last, let go. Then climb down and begin the rest of your life. With great joy! And I enjoy of it with great pleasure!
I believe that all the best wait for me!
And you can be my best!!!
I understand that there are not ideal people. But there are people who ideally fit each other. The main thing is to find and feel your native soul! And when you find him it is necessary to keep!!!
I want to be the reason you love the life!!!
I hope to find your letter from you soon.
Best wishes from your Inna.
