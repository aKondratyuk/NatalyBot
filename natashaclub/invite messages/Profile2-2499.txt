DEAR {name}! ARE YOU HERE TO FIND YOUR SECOND PART ON THIS SITE ? IF YES- LET\’S CHECK OUR CHANCE ! CAUSE I HAVE THE SAME GOAL !
EVERYBODY WANTS TO BE LOVED .And also to love. These two things are inseparable from each other. I think we are both here to turn this wish into reality. Let\'s try? Why not? I\'m common, kind and opened person. I like to do things that bring me pleasure. I always try to decorate my each day with something special . My friends tell that it is so hard to spend time without me ,they suppose I\’m the soul of each our events and have some special force –bringing positive emotions .
If to be honest , I don\’t know why they have such opinion , cause I\’m calm personality , I don\’t like loud parties I prefer cultural rest – theatre , cinema , some music concert or picnic with my close friends . I think it\’s important who are around you and just one cup of tea at cozy kitchen with kind person is better as a big banquet with strangers . And how about you ?What way of spending time do you prefer ?

I\'m family oriented person. I think that the main task for a woman is to take care for her family. Maybe I\'m old fashioned but I think happy man\’s eyes and high mood depends on his woman\’s mood . It\’s such rule – if wife in bad mood house becomes darker , but if she in good shape –the house becomes cozy and bright . Do you understand what I\’m talking about ?
That\’s why I taught myself to avoid negative emotions , to find something positive in bad situations .

I want to share with you one of my dream. Maybe it sounds strange but I dream to go for a walk with my man every night before go to sleep. It is so romantic, to spend some time every day together. And also it is useful for our health. ;) It\’s so great to have somethings which we could do together – our traditions , our rules . Do you like my dream? What can you add ?
My criteria for choosing a spouse isn\’t high – serious man who wants to find woman for life , someone whom I can be trust on .I have no criteria about the appearance , age , nationality or religion.
I love my parent\’s but their opinion isn\’t very important when it touches my own private life . I don\’t like advances in this sphere . And what about you ?
My family will agree with my any choice . They think I\’m alone for too long time and it\’s high time to get marriage :D:D Maybe they wants me to find husband more than I :D:D I\’m joking . It connects with their jokes :D

I\’m in good age to create family . I had two relations which were crashed . I\’ve took a lesson from it and I know what kind man I need and I found myself – I know what wife I can become for my husband . I\’m good as a cooker and housewife . You could check it one day . I invite you to visit my house – my face . It\’s better to see once as hear hundred times ;)

My name \“Nadia\” means – \“hope\” . So my hope and love is still living in my heart - it is waiting for owner .
Listen your heart and follow it. If our way to be together will be hard – we are on the right way . I will support you in your plans and wishes if you decide come to me .

I\'m waiting for your answer
Your full of love Nadia
