Hello, dear {name}! Will you be my bridegroom?
Yes, I agree it\â€™s maybe funny to write me it in the first letter but I am very serious like no other girls. Believe!
I want to find my life partner and be a good wife for him.
Of course you need to know something about me.
My friends tell that I am merry and energetic woman.
It will be never boring for me.
I am self-contained and busy woman.
I always keep myself in a good physical shape.
I like to travel and learn something new.
I can move to another country to live if I find my partner for mutual love!
I can meet in real time if your intentions are serious.
I am superb hostess and can easily create comfort at home. I like when everything is clean and neat, pleasant dishes and decorations.
I only need a partner to take care of him and share of all pleasant moments which we can have together!
I hope to find another letter from you soon
Best wishes from Nina
