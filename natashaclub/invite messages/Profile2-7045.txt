{name}, what dress should I choose for our first date? Red, white or elegant black? I hope, you don\’t mind of meeting a brave lady?;)

I have a question that makes me wonder…is love a fiction or reality nowadays? Can you be a man, who helps me to understand and discover the truth? I am not scared to take a risk! How about you?

I have decided to join this agency because of my cousin\’s happy experience. Now she is at the serious relations with man from Austria. They are dreaming about wedding. That\’s why my priority for the future years to find that real second half who will share with me all our good and not so good days, all our ups and downs, all our discoveries. I would like to learn English, to be a good dancer, to try my skills as a painter, to be an active traveler and to be able to visit as many counties as I can. When I find the man of my dreams I hope our list of goals will be longer and even more interesting. After some communication with foreigners, I firmly know what I want exactly.

You are different from Ukrainian men… because you are caring to your family …and I need a man with whom we both can treasure our LOVE, FAMILY and RELATIONSHIP!

I am willing to know you better!
Write me;)

Yours Adriana!
