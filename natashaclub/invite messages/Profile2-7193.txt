Dear {name}, I can only imagine how many letters you have got every day here.
Will you read mine? I don\'t know.
What kind of woman do you need? I don\'t know too.
But I know exactly if you are here you are not happy completely.
And maybe we can try our chance. What do you think?
I want to say that I am a usual woman, I love people, I love my job, I have two medical education and work as a beauty expert during 24 years, I\'m not a conflict person, I am open, communicative and attractive woman. Many people say I have a very nice magic voice. No, I don\'t sing but I notice when I talk to people they like to listen to me. Oh, I think I can give a lot of good advices for them. And yes, I am a clever woman.
So, only you can give us a chance to know each other.
Life is like a book. Some chapters are sad, some are happy and some are exciting, but if you never turn the page, you will never know what the next chapter has in store for you.
Will you have a page with us in your book?
I hope this letter finds you well.
I can\'t wait to hear from you!
Liliya
