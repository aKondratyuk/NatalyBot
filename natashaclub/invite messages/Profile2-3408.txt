{name}, Let\â€™s spend this summer together! 
I hope that you have a few minutes of free time to read my letter.... Everyone has own dream !!! Now my dream is to meet older man than me !! I believe that only with an older male I can have common interests because I am very serious and responsible girl !!I don\`t play games;) I don\'t like to waste time on empty talk!! I therefore hope that we can have great fellowship and later a serious relationship!! I need tenderness and love !! I think I\'m ready for a serious relationship so for me it was a very serious step to sign up here....I believe that a real sense ennobles man and rejuvenates her soul! For me love is the ability to give and not to take.Love is the Foundation of life. When you love you just have to live with. I love to travel and see new places!
Maybe we can do it together???
