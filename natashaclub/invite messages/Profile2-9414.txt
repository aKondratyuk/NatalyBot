{name}, what is the shape of your heart?) I am looking for the key to open it!My name is Yana and I am working as a nurse at the local hospital in Ukraine. I believe, life is a greatest gift that we have and that is why, I am positive and try to enjoy my life every new day. What about you?

I am a serious woman and all I need is to find a man with serious intention too!
What impression do you have after communicating with women here? I wonder because, I want to know what do men are looking for here? My family: I have loving parents, who are my support and friends at the same time, but it\’s not enough for me.
To my mind, love is the result of compatibility and similar expectation in life. If it\’s not so, relationship will be not successful. Do you agree?
I also believe, that when we meet someone, who captured our hearts, we immediately forget about things that makes us happy… We begin to learn, how to make someone else happy too. We make nice things, we find compromises and sacrifice our time for our beloved. For me, that is an ideal way to build a relationship with someone. Maybe, it\’s my fault that I can give all myself to the person, I truly love…However, I am not afraid of difficulties. I am ready for new experience and I truly believe, it will bring real love to my life.

If you are here for the same things and if my profile captured your attention, I will be glad to continue our acquaintance.

Yours Yana !!!
