I lost my mobile number! Could I have yours, {name}? I am joking with You, {name}


I\'m a lady from Ukraine, whose heart-beating is getting faster when I imagine my love partner near me. Nobody wants to be lonely, but it does not mean that we should be with someone, who can\'t make our heart warm. That\'s why there are so many people, who being smart, attractive, appealing, but still single. NO ! I DON\'T WANT TO BE SINGLE ANY MORE!! That\'s why I'm here, writing a letter to you!


I don\'t know you yet, but my lonely heart whispered me to write you, when I mentioned your profile on the site. Have you ever had such an inside feeling, which made you to do something? I don\'t know maybe, it\'s temptation, maybe intuition or maybe somebody can call it the sixth sense, but there is some power which rule our feelings and emotions.


I\'m very a positive and life-loving lady!! I\'m attentive to details, but I never concentrate on the bad things!! I like to laugh, travel, interact with interesting communicators, I like sweets and red wine!! I know that it\'s not enough for you, but my dear, if you want to get to know me better, to read me like a book( a very interesting book, by the way), so take away all your doubts and write me!! You will make my day with your nice reply!


I\'M NOT WAITING FOR A PRINCE, BUT I WANT TO MEET A MAN! A good, caring and loving ordinary man and I want to give him simple life joys, such as love, kisses, hugs, passionate nights, mutual evenings near the fire-place, sandwiches in the morning etc.


I\'m looking to hearing from you

Hugs and kisses!

Truly yours,

Natalia
