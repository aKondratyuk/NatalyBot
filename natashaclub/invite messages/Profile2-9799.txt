Hello, dear {name}!
Would you like to meet me and feel the ocean of my love?
I want to believe that you are the man from my fairy-tale, you are my magician and I\’m your fairy. I\’m not a little girl, I\’m an adult woman but I should like to feel something fabulous in my life. I hope you want to feel the same.
I try to compose myself if I\’m still single. God\’s looking at me right now thinking: \« I\’m saving her for someone special\». Maybe you are my special man?
You can\’t imagine how I\’m tired to be alone, to be a strong woman. I\’d like to be a weak woman at the strong man. I want to wake up in the morning and find myself in your strong hands and feel warm kisses, hot hugs and hear sweet words from you. What can be more wonderful than love? When you think about your loving adorable awesome man every second, when you want to be with him every minute, when all your heart is full of love!
Are you ready to feel the ocean of my love?
Can you save me of solitude?
I\’m looking forward to hear from you soonest.
Yours truly, Irina
