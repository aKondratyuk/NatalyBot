Dear {name}! Is your heart still free ? If yes , tell me where can I find key to open it ?
I don\'t like to speak much about myself , but I don\'t want to lose your interest . Because your profile caught my attention and I would like to know you better.
I believe in chemistry , and for me , it\'s a ground of successful relations. Two not perfect persons can create ideal love story . If there is appetence and understanding between two people they can overcome all troubles together. Do you agree ?
What is love for you ?
As you can see I\'m blonde lady , but be careful with stereotypes ! :D
 I\'m not a doll with big breast :D
 I\'m wise adult lady . Im a teacher at University and have spent much time on education . ;)


In one word , I have all what average person wants in Ukraine  own flat and good job . But I have feelings that is not a place where I want to live all my life .My heart is whispering me that my happiness and love are waiting for me abroad ;)
 Maybe it\'s your heart ? I\'m writing to you to check it .;)


I like travelling and studying foreign customs and traditions. Each time when I visit new country I try to read its history and find some interesting places on forums . I don\'t like to use guide for excursion , I always chose the route by myself . So it will be easy for me to adapt to a new sphere of life and move abroad .
Have you ever been in Ukraine , dear ? Would you like to be ?Now you have one reason for coming .It\'s me ;)

I value visual contact and will be glad to hear your voice 
I eagerly wait your reply .
Your new friend Julia .
