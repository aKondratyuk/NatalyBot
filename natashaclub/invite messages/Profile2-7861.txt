Hello, dear {name}!
Two are better than one... for if they fall, one will lift up the other.
Don\'t find love, let love find you. That\'s why it\'s called falling in love, because you don\'t force yourself to fall, you just fall.
Would you like to fall with me together? Would you like to learn if we are created for each other?
What do you think about it?
I am really tired to be alone. I would like to be with my special man! I need his attention, I need his love, warm words, hugs and kisses. I need him so much!!!
Can you be my special man? Can I be happy with you? Can I give you all my love, care and tenderness to you?
Can I be your ideal woman and ideal partner for you?
While you are busy looking for the perfect person, you\'ll probably miss the imperfect person who could make you perfectly happy.
I am full of love and need to share it with you!
Waiting for your letter so much!
Lyudmila
