{name}, I know a SECRET how to make you HAPPY! My grandmother always reminded me of an important rule when I was a little girl. \“A man should always return in a cozy home after work, where loving wife are waiting for him with a smile on her face. Delicious dinner and nice talks…That\’s all what a man needs after difficult day.\” Can I hear your thoughts about this issue?

Not long ago, I saw an interesting program about your country. It seems to me, women there are selfish and careerist. Is it really a truth? If so, I am shocked. From early childhood, parents taught me to appreciate family values. That is why, my biggest dream is to find a REAL LOVE as soon as possible.

For me, love is built on trust and respect. This feeling is deeper than the oceans and higher than the mountains. I had relationship in the past, but there was no love between us. Maybe I need someone mature, wise and patient…Someone, who will teach me something new and share life experience with me. Can you see the HUGE and BEAUTIFUL WORLD inside me ?

I can make your life like a PARADISE, if only you allow me to know you better…
I made a step. Now it\’s your turn)
Katerina!
