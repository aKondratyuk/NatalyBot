Hi {name} !!! Have you ever visited Lviv or Rivne? I live not far from the central square. Will we meet when you come? I decided that it is a time for important changes in my life and I am ready for new acquaintances here in my place.

I am very eager to build and take care of my future family. I know it will not be easy, but I am not afraid of hard work. I want my husband to know I will always be there to support his in everything he does. I want to make sure he knows I am always there to help him, listen to him, and help with any problems that come our way. Smile

After some experience of learning the foreign countries and also communication with foreign men, I have decided to find the serious man for creating the family union abroad. It is a serious and adult decision. As you noticed that I am not a little lady. I am woman with some life\â€™s experience and I am ready for cardinal changes. Now I am working on improving my English level because IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT for me. I am open to speak through comfortable internet tools if our relations are also interesting and serious. Will you help me to practice it? Together, {name}?
Elvira
