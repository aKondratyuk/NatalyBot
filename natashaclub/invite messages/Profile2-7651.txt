{name}, DO YOU want to GET a sweet PRESENT? HERE IT IS! :)

Unwrap it faster! What do you see? Yes, baby, it\'s me. I\'m very glad to be here and meet you! What a chance! They say there is nothing occasional in this life. I agree with it. And you?

So, let\'s start our communication and I promise I will make your life bright and lovely :wink:

Let me tell you something about me :) I\'m cheerful and optimistic. I adore my life and I\'m grateful to my parents for it. Being young, I already think of my future. I see it colorful, happy, full of interesting events. But the most important is my own future family that I want to build with a man abroad. I consider him more dependable, well-read, self-supporting and loyal of course.

Since my childhood, I have been interested in everything foreign, especially films and music. English was my favorite subject at school. Although it\'s not perfect, I can read some books and magazines in English or see TV programs. But I\'d like to ameliorate it of course :) Self-development is so important for me.

As you know, there isn\'t a mental health without physical one. That\'s why I practice running in the morning and aerobics exercises twice a week. It helps me to relax and fresh my mind.

Yes, my life is full enough, but I\'d like to share my energy, cheerfulness and my heart with YOU! :oops:. Tell me about your life. What is it? I\'ll be very glad to get to know you as much faster as possible :) I\'ll be waiting for YOUR ANSWER.

YOUR SWEET PRESENT,
TANYA
