Hello, dear {name}! Be my new bright page in my life!
You are better than the man of my dreams! You are real!
All of us have our advantages and disadvantages, all we have our own mistakes. Nobody can be ideal and perfect. And I understand it very well.
I don’t need the perfect man…I want the man who is perfect for me!
I don\’t want the perfect relationship, because perfect is impossible. I want trustworthy, honest, loyalty and love.
I had in my life one sad story but now I am ready to open my heart again and start a new page! And you?
I want to find a good man that can bright my life and show me how wonderful the relationship between a man and a woman can be. I want he will teach me truly love, open the power of my sexuality and explain how to be the best woman for him. Are you ready to be that special man?
From my side I want to help him to achieve his goals in life, support him when he\’s broke, push him to be successful, shower him with positive energy, compliment him and never kick him when he\’s down.
Would you like to find a woman like that and to make her a real partner for life?
Maybe at this moment you have the great chance to meet your right woman!
I think it will be great to meet you and feel it is possible to build our relationship.
What do you think about our meeting?
Awaiting your response very much...
Irina
