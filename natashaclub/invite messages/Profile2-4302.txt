{name}, àre you still alone? I hope for a lucky chance of our acquaintance. I am here only because of one reason – I am looking for true love! This search has pushed me to write my letter to you. I hope our acquaintance will bring us a lot of positive emotions and lead us to the soon meeting. What do you think?
Trustful relationships with sincere and passionate feelings are my main life goal! To be successful in life and making a career are the things I am also going to fulfill. But being a good professional is nothing when you haven\’t got anyone special to come back after work. Do you share my points of view?
I was working as a manager, but thinking about starting something special. I am not bad at stylish hairdo. I finished my studying course some months ago and now have regular clients. I work on developing my skills by attending trainings and professional seminars.
Step by step, I improve my English and right now I am taking a language course at the local studying centre. Sometimes it\’s really exhausting to combine work and studying, but I am not going to give up. In such difficult moments I dream about the possibility to escape from the city life for a weekend, far away from all worries and troubles. Will you accompany me?
Now come up to the mirror, smile to yourself, and just for a moment imagine myself by your side. How do we look together as a couple? Nice?
Waiting for your reply,
Warmly,
Maryna
