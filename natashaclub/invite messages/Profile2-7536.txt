{name}, let\'s WRITE a SCRIPT of our life TOGETHER! I\'M SURE THAT TO BECAME HAPPY YOU SHOULD DO ONLY THINGS THAT MAKE YOU HAPPY!

I\'m glad to find you here! So I want to communicate with you, if you never mind :)

My name is Elena and last 3 years I\'m not lucky in love. Here in Ukraine I have really good job, and I live absolutely independent for my pleasure. But I feel that one part of my life is empty. I think that the most important thing in life is family and now I feel that I want to create it! But in my life there is no serious man :(

Some time ago my best friend decided to register here, I thought that she is crazy. But late she told me some stories and about men from different countries. I was surprised because I know only Ukrainian men and used to their behavior. But I don\'t like it, they are too selfish and can only demand and don\'t give anything in return.

My best friend\'s story has happy end. She has found her love and move to her future husband! I\'m really happy for her, and that\'s why I believe that I can meet someone special here. Maybe it\'s you? :oops:

Hope so. Also I want to say that I\'m ready to move anywhere to be happy with my man! I think that the most important person in family is husband. He should to decide where to live, and wife should to make this place to be real home. Only in this way everyone will be happy.

I\'m working as photographer, so I love traveling to get more and more beautiful pictures. In Ukraine for me the most beautiful place is Crimea. The nature there is so wonderful and the air is so clean. Also I like Kyiv, do you ever been here? If you will come, I\'ll be your guide, agreed?

I will end my letter here but hope to hear back from you very soon ;)

Elena
